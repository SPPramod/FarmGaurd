# FarmGuard: Plant Disease Prediction

## 📌 Overview
FarmGuard is a deep learning-based application that detects plant diseases using image classification. It provides accurate disease predictions and suggests recommendations to help farmers take preventive actions.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts plant diseases from leaf images
- Provides treatment recommendations
- Streamlit-based user interface
- Model trained using TensorFlow and Keras

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SPPramod/FarmGaurd.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd FarmGaurd
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

## 🧪 Model Training
The model is trained using a dataset of plant leaf images, classified into different disease categories. The training pipeline includes:
- Data Augmentation
- Transfer Learning (EfficientNet, ResNet, or MobileNet)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 🎯 Limitations
- May require a large dataset for higher accuracy
- Works best with clear, high-quality images
- Performance may vary for different plant species
